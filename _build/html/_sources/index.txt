Introduction
===============================================


We have experimented with three different methods for measuring nitrate levels in water samples with the colorimeter:

#. **Hach NitraVer5 reagent**  
#. **API test kit** 
#. **Nitrate reductase method** 


The first step in measuring nitrate levels in water is reduction (chemically or enzymatically) of nitrate (NO\ :sub:`3`\)  to nitrite (NO\ :sub:`2`\). Methods 1 & 2 listed above use cadmium-reduction (APHA Standard Method )  
wheras method 3 uses a plant enzyme, Nitrate reductase. All 3 assays measure nitrite levels with the `Greiss test <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griess_test>`_ as the final colorimetric assay step. 

Of these three methods tested so far, we prefer to use the **Hach NitraVer5** reagent. Although it does use the cadmium-reduction method, it is easier to use than the enzyme assay and is more reproducible than the API test kit in our experience.
