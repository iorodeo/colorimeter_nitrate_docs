Reagents & Equipment
----------------------------

* Colorimeter with 400 nm LED (part # COLOR-400)
* Cuvettes (macro or semi-macro)
* NitraVer 5 Nitrate Reagent for 10 mL samples, Hach cat # 21061-69
* Stir plate and stir bar for mixing
* 1 mL pipette
* Small beaker
* (Optional) Distilled water for sample dilutions

Colorimeter set-up
------------------------

* Wavelength: 400 nm 
* Nitrate standard data: Mid-range works well (0 - 80 ppm NO3). Download a data file or prepare your own nitrate standard data
* Before measuring blank the colorimeter against water or a distilled water sample developed with NitraVer 5 reagent as described below


Method
---------

* Transfer 10 mL of water sample to a small beaker with a stir bar and place on stir plate.
* Add the contents of a packet of NitraVer5 to the beaker and start mixing. 
* After 1 minute, take the beaker off the stir plate. Remove the stir bar.
* Wait at least 5 mins for the color to develop.
* Pour some of the sample into a cuvette, place in the colorimeter and click measure. The program will return the nitrate concentration in ppm.
